Requirments

After the problem and potential solution become clear, they define each stakeholder’s potential interaction(s) 
with a solution, including the solution objectives, success, and acceptance criteria from the perspective of the stakeholder.
To provide a comprehensive picture of the subject gait many parameters are required to be 
measured.Due to the time and budget,only certain parameters will be measured.The device must
be:
1. Be able to capture the conductive and inductive proximity data in an unobtrusive and reliable manner to get
meaningful data,This data should able to allow the algorithm to reliably determine the specific 
condition such as material has metallic or non metalic properties.
2. be able to capture image data of material  in an unobtrusive and reliable manner to ge meaningful data
.This should able to allow the computer vision algorithm to reliably determine the specific parameters of image.
3. Be able to send all parametrs determine from above two funcnality to machine learning algorithm
 to determine the type of material.
4. Return data to the system to  perform the task of actuator which trasfer the material to its specific bin.
5. device help shops to decrease the waste management budget.
6. it help to increase the recycing percentage of cups and make cleaner environment
7. User are now free from knowing the type of cup material,device sort automatically for them
